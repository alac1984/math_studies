	1. Every person will shake hands with 9 other people. And a handshake is something that "belongs" to both participants. So it's $\frac{10 * 9}{2} = 45$.
	  
	2. Zeno ate! $2 * 26 = 52$ hotdogs. The total hotdogs eaten was 
	$$
	\sum_{i=1}^{26} i*2 = 2 * \sum_{i=1}^{26} i = 2 * \frac{26 * 27}{2} = 351
	$$

	3. Let's break the propositions:

	p: If this chess is empty

	q: The other chest's message is true

	The left chest message is $p \rightarrow q$.

	r: This chest is filled with treasure
	s: The other chest contains deadly scorpions

	The right chest message is $p \wedge q$.

	If I open left chest and it's empty, so, as $p \rightarrow q$:

	$$T \rightarrow q$$

	For this to be true, q must be true. But if q is true, them the right chest message is true, otherwise left chest message must be false, what is a paradox. So the first chest could not be empty and therefore the left chess message could never be the true one.

	For the right chess message to be true, either this chess is filled with treasure of the other is filled with deadly scorpions. I cannot guarantee that this chest is filled with treasure, but is at least safe to open and test it.
	
	4. No, it is not. There's no physical configuration that make possible to draw connections for all other towns without intersections.

	\subsection{Investigate, pg. 4}

  Let's start by analyzing each of the troll's statements:

  Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.

  Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.

  Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.
  
  First, we need to note that there cannot be three knaves because Troll 3's statement would be a lie in this scenario, which can't be the case.

  Second, there cannot be three knights, as that would make Troll 1's statement a lie, which again can't be the case.

  Given these two observations, we know there must be at least one knight and at least one knave. This leaves us with three possibilities:

  There are two knights and one knave.

  There are two knaves and one knight.

  Let's consider these possibilities.

  If there are two knights and one knave, the only way this can happen given the trolls' statements is if Troll 1 is a knight, Troll 2 is a knave, and Troll 3 is a knight. This is because, if Troll 1 were a knave, then his statement would be true, which can't be the case.

  If there are two knaves and one knight, the only way this can happen is if Troll 1 is a knave, Troll 2 is a knave, and Troll 3 is a knight. This is because, if Troll 3 were a knave, then his statement would be true, which can't be the case.

  So, there's a contradiction in your original reasoning: you've got two scenarios, but one of them must be wrong because in each scenario, we have a different number of knights and knaves.

  After a detailed analysis of the trolls' statements, we can conclude that the only possible configuration is that Troll 1 is a knight, Troll 2 is a knave, and Troll 3 is a knight.

  \textbf{Truth Tables:}

  Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.

  This statement can be translated as:

  p: I am a knave (Troll 1)

  q: There are exactly two knights here

    F (knight) & F (not two knights) & T \\
    F (knight) & T (two knights) & T \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  }

  Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.

  This statement can be translated as:

  p: Troll 1 is not telling the truth

    \hline
    T (truth) & F (lie) \\
    F (lie) & T (truth) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  }

  Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.

  This statement can be translated as:

  p: We are all knaves (Troll 3)

  q: At least one of us is a knight

  {
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{10pt} % increase space between columns
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} % increase space between rows
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $p$ (All knaves) & $q$ (One knight) & $p \vee q$ (Troll 3) \\
    \hline
    T (all knaves) & F (no knights) & T \\
    T (all knaves) & T (one knight) & T \\
    F (not all knaves) & F (no knights) & F \\
    F (not all knaves) & T (one knight) & T \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  }

  The configuration that makes all statements correct (given that a knight always tells the truth and a knave always lies) is the following:

  Troll 1 is a knight (because "If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here" is true when Troll 1 is a knight and there are not exactly two knights)

  Troll 2 is a knave (because "Troll 1 is lying" is a lie when Troll 1 is a knight)

  Troll 3 is a knight (because "Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight" is true when there's at least one knight)

  Therefore, the correct answer is: Troll 1 is a knight, Troll 2 is a knave, and Troll 3 is a knight.
